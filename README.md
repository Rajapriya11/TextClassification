A Text classification system has been created to identify the category of the given input text focusing on the Business, Sports and Science from the a news Website.
This pipeline involves the transformation of text data into numerical vectors (text vectorization) and the utilization of the specified model for classification. 
It uses cross validate function from scikit-learn, TFIDF Vectorizer is used for feature extraction. The TfidfVectorizer computes the term frequency- Inverse document frequency representation for the text data based on the given parameters. It retrieves the entire corpus of the documents. Assigns higher weight to the words which appears frequently in a specific document.

A Simple GUI is built using TKinter library for text classification is shown below
