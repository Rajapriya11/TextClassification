      "Renters compete with 20 others in battle to find a home Competition among renters is so intense that there are 20 requests to view each available property, according to data commissioned by the BBC. The average number of requests to see each home has more than tripled from six in 2019, the figures from property portal Rightmove show. The queue to view is even longer in some regions, reaching 30 in the North West of England. One family in the area said finding a home was stressful and hard. Demi and Andrew, who are both self-employed and have five children, said they faced \"ridiculous prices\", a lack of options, and a wall of silence from some agents before finding somewhere suitable near Preston. \"You can have all the money in the world, but it would still be a long process,\" said Demi as she looked around a home in which 50 people had shown an interest. \"You go around in circles. It is so frustrating.\" Demand from prospective renters has soared as rising mortgage rates are making home ownership a more distant prospect and prompting some landlords to sell up.  In every region, the number has tripled at the least since 2019. Anecdotal evidence shows tenants are offering more than the asking rent, or arriving early to get to the front of the queue. Paul Forbes, an estate agent in Preston, said that properties were often let after the first block viewing of interested home-hunters because demand is so high. Choosing the successful applicant was \"not a nice part of the job\", he said. Previous research by the BBC recently revealed how rental applicants with children and pets have found it even harder to secure a place.  UPS reaches deal with Teamsters union to avert strike A strike at shipping giant UPS appears to have been averted in the US, after the company reached a tentative deal with the union that represents much of its staff. The union said the agreement would \"set a new standard\" for all delivery workers, granting raises, more full-time jobs and \"dozens\" of new workplace improvements and protections.  It also sets starting pay at $21 per hour for new part-time workers. UPS called it a \"win-win-win\" deal. UPS chief executive Carole Tom√© said the agreement would continue to reward UPS staff with \"industry-leading pay and benefits\" while still allowing the company to stay competitive. UPS has the biggest unionised workforce of any company in the US, with more than 300,000 full- and part-time workers - such as drivers - represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union. A strike could have been significantly disruptive to the economy in the US, where the company carries an estimated quarter of the parcels shipped each day. The union had been holding practice strike pickets in recent weeks to push the company after talks broke off earlier this month. It will now present the proposed five-year contract to its members for approval.  \"We demanded the best contract in the history of UPS, and we got it,\" said Teamster General President Sean M. O'Brien. \"This contract sets a new standard in the labour movement and raises the bar for all workers.\"  Child Trust Funds: Nearly a million accounts not accessed Nearly a million young people have yet to claim their Child Trust Funds, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee estimates that more than ¬£1.7bn is sitting in accounts waiting to be accessed. It says \"failure in long-term planning\" by HMRC means 42% of eligible 18-20 year olds have not drawn on their savings. An HMRC spokesperson said they had notified young people before their account matured.  The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said that while these accounts were a vital \"financial jump start\" to adulthood, the scheme so far had not achieved that ambition. Under the Labour government policy, any child born between 2002 and 2011 was eligible to receive at least ¬£250 in a savings pot, which they could access as soon as they turned 18. An average account contains ¬£1,900. However, according to MPs, poor planning by HMRC, a lack of engagement with account holders and barriers accessing savings meant that many from low-income backgrounds were missing out. Children who lack capacity were particularly affected, with an estimated 80,000 having to rely on their families to go through a lengthy, often costly court process to access their savings. Harry is one of those 80,000. His mum, Ramandeep Kaur, has saved more than ¬£7,000 in his savings account - assuming he would be able to access it like his older brother. But, she has been told the only way 16-year-old Harry, who has Down Syndrome and a love of Bollywood dancing, can access his money is if she goes through the Court of Protection. \"I don't know what to do to be honest, the money will mean so much to Harry - but at the same time the bureaucracy, cost, and overall impact of the legal implications is huge.  \"I saved for my son, like I did for his brother - the whole system is wrong if it deprives Harry of what is rightfully his.\" The committee also found that trust fund providers were not only failing to keep customers informed, they were also charging fees - up to ¬£100m a year - just to passively manage the accounts. More than 800,000 accounts belong to people from low-income backgrounds - prompting concern that those who need the money the most were not able to access it.

It is so frustrating.\" Demand from prospective renters has soared as rising mortgage rates are making home ownership a more distant prospect and prompting some landlords to sell up.  In every region, the number has tripled at the least since 2019. Anecdotal evidence shows tenants are offering more than the asking rent, or arriving early to get to the front of the queue. Paul Forbes, an estate agent in Preston, said that properties were often let after the first block viewing of interested home-hunters because demand is so high. Choosing the successful applicant was \"not a nice part of the job\", he said. Previous research by the BBC recently revealed how rental applicants with children and pets have found it even harder to secure a place.  UPS reaches deal with Teamsters union to avert strike A strike at shipping giant UPS appears to have been averted in the US, after the company reached a tentative deal with the union that represents much of its staff. The union said the agreement would \"set a new standard\" for all delivery workers, granting raises, more full-time jobs and \"dozens\" of new workplace improvements and protections.  It also sets starting pay at $21 per hour for new part-time workers. UPS called it a \"win-win-win\" deal. UPS chief executive Carole Tom√© said the agreement would continue to reward UPS staff with \"industry-leading pay and benefits\" while still allowing the company to stay competitive. UPS has the biggest unionised workforce of any company in the US, with more than 300,000 full- and part-time workers - such as drivers - represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union. A strike could have been significantly disruptive to the economy in the US, where the company carries an estimated quarter of the parcels shipped each day. The union had been holding practice strike pickets in recent weeks to push the company after talks broke off earlier this month. It will now present the proposed five-year contract to its members for approval.  \"We demanded the best contract in the history of UPS, and we got it,\" said Teamster General President Sean M. O'Brien. \"This contract sets a new standard in the labour movement and raises the bar for all workers.\"  Child Trust Funds: Nearly a million accounts not accessed Nearly a million young people have yet to claim their Child Trust Funds, MPs have warned. The Public Accounts Committee estimates that more than ¬£1.7bn is sitting in accounts waiting to be accessed. It says \"failure in long-term planning\" by HMRC means 42% of eligible 18-20 year olds have not drawn on their savings. An HMRC spokesperson said they had notified young people before their account matured.  The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said that while these accounts were a vital \"financial jump start\" to adulthood, the scheme so far had not achieved that ambition. Under the Labour government policy, any child born between 2002 and 2011 was eligible to receive at least ¬£250 in a savings pot, which they could access as soon as they turned 18. An average account contains ¬£1,900. However, according to MPs, poor planning by HMRC, a lack of engagement with account holders and barriers accessing savings meant that many from low-income backgrounds were missing out. Children who lack capacity were particularly affected, with an estimated 80,000 having to rely on their families to go through a lengthy, often costly court process to access their savings. Harry is one of those 80,000. His mum, Ramandeep Kaur, has saved more than ¬£7,000 in his savings account - assuming he would be able to access it like his older brother. But, she has been told the only way 16-year-old Harry, who has Down Syndrome and a love of Bollywood dancing, can access his money is if she goes through the Court of Protection. \"I don't know what to do to be honest, the money will mean so much to Harry - but at the same time the bureaucracy, cost, and overall impact of the legal implications is huge.  \"I saved for my son, like I did for his brother - the whole system is wrong if it deprives Harry of what is rightfully his.\" The committee also found that trust fund providers were not only failing to keep customers informed, they were also charging fees - up to ¬£100m a year - just to passively manage the accounts. More than 800,000 accounts belong to people from low-income backgrounds - prompting concern that those who need the money the most were not able to access it.   Renters compete with 20 others in battle to find a home Competition among renters is so intense that there are 20 requests to view each available property, according to data commissioned by the BBC. The average number of requests to see each home has more than tripled from six in 2019, the figures from property portal Rightmove show. The queue to view is even longer in some regions, reaching 30 in the North West of England. One family in the area said finding a home was stressful and hard. Demi and Andrew, who are both self-employed and have five children, said they faced \"ridiculous prices\", a lack of options, and a wall of silence from some agents before finding somewhere suitable near Preston. \"You can have all the money in the world, but it would still be a long process,\" said Demi as she looked around a home in which 50 people had shown an interest. \"You go around in circles.
